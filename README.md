# ShapeHandler

Let's be real: <b>coding could have been so much easier back in high school.</b> I always found myself wondering why I could never find any helpful formulas that would save me and countless other programmers hours of Googling different formulas and having to implement them ourselves, only to use them in few lines of code.

That is why I created the <i>ShapeHandler</i> project.  Being made for both Java and Kotlin, there are classes of 2D and 3D shapes that you can put into your own projects to quickly calculate the perimeter, area, etc. of a shape given specific parameters. Here are the current available shapes:

| 2D Shapes     | 3D Shapes |
|---------------|-----------|
| Triangle      | Cube      |
| Rectangle     | Cuboid    |
| Square        | Cylinder  |
| Circle        | Pyramid   |
| Trapezoid     | Sphere    |
| Ellipse       |           |
| Parallelogram |           |
| Kite          |           |
| Polygon       |           |

## Installation
Go to the <b>Releases</b> page in this repository. There are two zipped files: one for Java, and one for Kotlin. Download the zipped file corresponding to the language that you will be using, and extract it. 
You will then see a package containing two files: 2DShapes and 3DShapes. You will have to import it into your project to use it. But luckily, this is simple enough.

For Kotlin:
``` kt
import shapehandler.code.kotlin.*
```


And for Java:
``` java
import shapehandler.code.java.twoD.*;
import shapehandler.code.java.threeD.*;
```

And that's it! You're ready to <i>shape up</i> your code!
 Have fun!
